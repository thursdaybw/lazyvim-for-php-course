# Welcome to Neovim Navigation Practice!

## Moving Between Lines (j, k)
First, try using `j` to **move down** to this line.

Now, press `k` to **move back up** to the previous line.

Keep pressing `j` to move down further and `k` to move back up.  
This helps you navigate a file without using arrow keys.

## Moving by Characters (h, l)
Move your cursor to the **start** of this line.  
Now, press `l` to move **right**, one character at a time.

Press `h` to move **left** and go back.

Try moving **back and forth** along this line using only `h` and `l`.

## Moving by Words (w, e, b)
Now, move down here using `j`.

Press `w` to jump forward **to the start of the next word**.

Press `e` to move forward **to the end of a word**.

Press `b` to move **back to the start of the previous word**.

Practice with these words:  
banana apple orange strawberry pineapple

## Jumping to the Start and End of a File (gg, G)
Press `gg` to jump **to the top** of this file.  
Press `G` to jump **to the bottom** of this file.  

Try jumping to the top (`gg`) and then immediately back to the bottom (`G`).

## Moving by Paragraphs ({, })
Move down here using `j` until your cursor is on this line.

Now, press `{` to jump **up** to the start of the previous paragraph.

Press `}` to jump **down** to the start of the next paragraph.

Paragraph 1:  
This is a block of text that you should practice navigating with `{` and `}`.  

Paragraph 2:  
Move between paragraphs to quickly jump through sections of a document.

## Scrolling (Ctrl-d, Ctrl-u)
Use `Ctrl-d` to **scroll down** by half a page.  
Use `Ctrl-u` to **scroll up** by half a page.  

Try scrolling **down** a few times, then back **up**.
